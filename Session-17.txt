Maven
----
It can be downloaded from maven.apache.org


Maven is dependent on jdk for two reasons
1.Maven requires java to compile a code or package etc 
2.Maven itself is written in java

What is the latest version of java?
1.13

Site for openjdk
http://openjdk.java.net/install/

yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y

Note:This is open java,learn how to install oracle java

both are from oracle corporation bu the only difference is we have support for Oracle java but not for open java

After java lets install apache-maven from http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

just download it to /opt no need to install since it is a runtime binary files(means you can extrat it and use it)

path setup done
