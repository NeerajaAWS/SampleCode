Session 10 took on Oct15

----------------

Branches

1.Feature branch
2.

navigate to new directory /root and download the code from central repository

[root@ip-172-31-90-8 ~]# git clone https://github.com/NeerajaAWS/SampleCode.git

41b9dd5 Restored files from commit:b2542c8
c1d523a Added new lines to HelloWorld.java
aa6f31b Updated HelloWorld and added Goodbye
b2542c8 This is a new code example
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/NeerajaAWS/SampleCode.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/NeerajaAWS/SampleCode.git (push)
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]#


checking branch
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]#


Now lets create a feature branch and switch to it
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git branch feature/facebook
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git branch -a
  feature/facebook
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git checkout feature/facebook
Switched to branch 'feature/facebook'
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git branch -a
* feature/facebook
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]#


Question:What is the difference between untracked file and modified file git?
Ans:
Untracked file is a new file created in workspace
Modified file is a file thats been modified in staging area

note:Command used to add and commit at-time will work on only modified file but not on untracked files

[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# vi HelloWorld.java
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git status
On branch feature/facebook
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   HelloWorld.java

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git commit -a -m "Adding some new code for mail feature"
[feature/facebook c3ebf68] Adding some new code for mail feature
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git status
On branch feature/facebook
nothing to commit, working tree clean

Pushing code from local branch to central new branch
----------------------------------------------

first find out the remote location to the current branch
 [root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]#  git remote -v
 origin  https://github.com/NeerajaAWS/SampleCode.git (fetch)
 origin  https://github.com/NeerajaAWS/SampleCode.git (push)
 [root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git push origin feature/facebook
 Username for 'https://github.com': NeerajaAWS
 Password for 'https://NeerajaAWS@github.com':

 remote: Create a pull request for 'feature/facebook' on GitHub by visiting:
 remote:      https://github.com/NeerajaAWS/SampleCode/pull/new/feature/facebook
 remote:
 To https://github.com/NeerajaAWS/SampleCode.git
  * [new branch]      feature/facebook -> feature/facebook

Merging
-------

Note that whenever or whoever dowloading a code or script they will be downloading it from the master branch not from any other branches

so inorder to merge the updated code in branches to master branch


Pull request is also a merging process but it's a merge request with approval process(control authority)


Branch protection rules:
Define branch protection rules to disable force pushing, prevent branches from being deleted, and optionally require status checks before merging

options:
1.Require pull request reviews before merging
2.Require status checks to pass before merging
3.Require signed commits
4.Include administrators


GUI
once we set the branching rule,create a pull request and once it is approved we can see changes are updated in master

CLI
to merge a branch we need to switch to destination branch(here in this case master)and run the below command
#git checkout master
#git merge feature/facebook


Deleting a branch
-----------------

note:Never run #git push -f ----- this will overwrite your central repository with local(you may loose your job for this mistake)

Now coming to deleting a branch

first we need to delete branch in local
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git branch -d feature/facebook
error: Cannot delete branch 'feature/facebook' checked out at '/root/SampleCode'
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]#

here it fails because we are currently in the same brach.so we are switching to master

[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git branch -a
  feature/facebook
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/feature/facebook
  remotes/origin/master
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git branch -d feature/facebook
error: The branch 'feature/facebook' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D feature/facebook'.
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git branch -D feature/facebook
Deleted branch feature/facebook (was c3ebf68).
[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]#


branch deleted locally

need to delete in repository too

[root@ip-172-31-90-8 SampleCode]# git push -d origin feature/facebook
Username for 'https://github.com': NeerajaAWS
Password for 'https://NeerajaAWS@github.com':
